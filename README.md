Mr. Sneed is a whimsical gnome chatbot built using <a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-python"> OpenAi's API</a> and the ChatGPT 
(GPT 3.5-Turbo) model. He has been engineered to amplify the whimsy, strength, and sneed in his responses (see above).

Utilizing natural language processing alongside ChatGPT, Mr. Sneed's responses come to life as he exhibits
a range of emotions and audible responses.

<sub> A small thank you note: Although this program started as a joke (check the first commit), my friends inspired me to exercise my creativity and really refine the chat bot. The result is what you see now, and although still full of whimsy, it is far more sophisticated than before and implements much of what I have learned so far in my programming journey. This would not have been possible without the people above. </sub>


<sub><sup>***DISCLAIMER: Mr. Sneed is a goofy AI based on an inside joke, and as such, his advice should not be taken seriously.</sub></sup>
